# MP3Toolbox

#This is and mp3 player for the Matlab Environment.

###What is this ?
This repository is actually an old lecture of mine when I was at the university.
It is basically a discrete real-time FFT mp3 toolbox. Capable to plot the DFT
as the file is playing. It contains three different DTF algorithms.
   
###How can I install it ?
Clone this repository first inside Malab/toolbox.
Then click File -> Set Path -> Add with sub-folders.
Click the mp3 toolbox and OK. You are done.
Type "help openmp3" ( without the quotes ).
If an output is present, you have done it right.
   
###How can I use the mp3 player ?
Type "help openmp3" ( without the quotes ).
It will show you how to use it.
Open an mp3 file by setting the argument to its path.
*It will start running. Type `help` to explore additional options
The function uses the fastest iterative divider DFT algorithm `myfft1` of the all three.**
