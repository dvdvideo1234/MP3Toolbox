# MP3Toolbox

This is and mp3 player for the Matlab Environment.

```
Q: What is this ?
A: This repository is actually an old lecture of mine when I was at the university.
   It is basically a discrete real-time FFT mp3 toolbox. Capable to plot the DFT
   as the file is playing. It contains three different DTF algorithms.
   
Q: How can I install it ?
A: Clone this repository first inside Malab/toolbox.
   Then click File -> Set Path -> Add with subfolders.
   Click the mp3 toolbaox and OK. You are done.
   Type "help openmp3" ( without the quotes ).
   If an output is present, you have done it right.
   
Q: How can I use the mp3 player ?
A: Type "help openmp3" ( without the quotes ).
   It will show you how to use it.
   pen an mp3 file by setting the argument to its path.
   It will start running. Type "help" to explore additional options
N: The function uses the fastest iterative divider DFT algorithm ( myfft1 ) of the all three.
